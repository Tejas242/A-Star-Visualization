# A* Algorithm Visualization

This is a Python implementation of the A* search algorithm, along with a simple GUI for visualizing the algorithm's search process on a two-dimensional grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (e.g. `pip install pygame`).
3. Run the script `pathfinder.py`.
4. The `pathfinder_terminal.py` for terminal text based version.
5. Observe the algorithm as it searches for a path from the top left corner to the bottom right corner of the grid.

## Features

- Customizable grid size and obstacle density.
- Interactive visualization of the algorithm's search process.
- Uses a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path.
